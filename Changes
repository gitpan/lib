Revision history for Perl extension lib

0.57  Mon May 26 16:22 2008
  - First release to CPAN. Previously available in core perl.
  - Released to CPAN in order to backport a fix for
    "use lib 'foo.par'" which should not warn about
    foo.par being a file. (Any files with other extensions
    still trigger warnings as appropriate.)
